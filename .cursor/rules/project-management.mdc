When we plan work, use the Linear MCP connection to create, update and close tasks. Use Sub-tasks for enumerating steps in the task.

If the tasks are part of a group of work, check for an existing Milestone that match the tasks. If a matching Milestone doesn't exist, create one before adding the tasks, and then add them inside it. Examples Milestones might be like "Phase 2: Frontend Templates" or "Phase 1 (Essential)". 

All tasks for this repository go in the Linear project named "Verdoy".
