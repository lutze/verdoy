## Frontend Guidelines (HTML/CSS/Minimal JS)

**HTML Templates (Jinja2):**
- Semantic HTML5 elements (article, section, nav, etc.)
- Proper form elements with labels and validation
- Accessible table structures for data display
- Progressive disclosure for complex interfaces

**CSS Approach:**
- Mobile-first responsive design
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Avoid CSS frameworks unless essential
- Focus on readability and scientific data presentation

**HTMX Integration:**
- Use `hx-*` attributes for dynamic behavior
- Update specific page sections, not entire page
- Handle real-time sensor data with `hx-sse` or `hx-ws`
- Graceful degradation when HTMX fails

**Minimal JavaScript:**
- Only for features impossible with HTML/CSS/HTMX
- Vanilla JavaScript, no libraries unless essential
- Use Web APIs directly (Fetch, WebSocket, etc.)
- Progressive enhancement pattern
- Handle errors gracefully


## Frontend Rules

**Before adding any code, ask:**
1. Does it work without JavaScript? (must be yes)
2. Can CSS handle this instead of JS?
3. Is this complexity serving users or developers?

**Use JavaScript only for:**
- WebSocket/SSE real-time updates
- Chart libraries (with table fallbacks)
- AJAX form enhancement (not replacement)

**Never use JavaScript for:**
- Page routing
- Initial content rendering  
- Basic interactions (use CSS)


## Performance Checklist

- [ ] Page loads < 1 second
- [ ] Works without JavaScript
- [ ] Forms submit with Enter key
- [ ] Back button works correctly
- [ ] URLs are bookmarkable
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works
- [ ] Screen reader compatible
- [ ] No loading spinners on initial load

## Scientific Data Guidelines

- Validate sensor ranges (e.g., temperature: -50°C to 150°C)
- Store UTC timestamps with microsecond precision
- Implement data retention (archive >1 year)
- Batch insert high-frequency sensor data
- Version control experiment protocols
- Maintain audit trail for GLP compliance)
