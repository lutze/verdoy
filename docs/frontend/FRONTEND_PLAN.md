2. **‚úÖ Base Template**: Create `base.html` with navigation, layout, and responsive design **COMPLETE**
3. **‚úÖ Authentication**: Implement login, registration, logout, and profile pages **COMPLETE**
4. **‚úÖ Dashboard**: Build user dashboard with orgs, stats, and activity feed **COMPLETE**
5. **üÜï Navigation Refactor**: Update all frontend routes and navigation to use `/app`-based URLs **NEXT**
6. **üÜï Base Home Page**: Create a root-level home page as the main entry point **NEXT**
7. **‚úÖ Organization Management**: CRUD flows for organizations **COMPLETE**

### üîß **Recent Technical Fixes**
- Fixed Docker static file path: `directory="app/static"`
- Fixed Docker templates path: `directory="app/templates"`
- Resolved container startup issues
- Verified API endpoints and template rendering
- **Authentication System**: Complete with content negotiation
- **Navigation Component**: Responsive navbar with authentication state
- **Router Registration**: Fixed auth routes with `/api/v1` prefix consistency

### üìã **Development Best Practices Learned**
- **Docker Rebuilds**: Always force complete rebuild (`docker compose down && docker compose build --no-cache && docker compose up -d`) when making route or backend structural changes
- **Content Negotiation**: Single endpoints serving both HTML and JSON based on Accept headers
- **API Consistency**: Maintain `/api/v1` prefix for all endpoints (web browsers and programmatic clients)
- **Template Caching**: Python import caching can prevent route changes from taking effect without full rebuild

## 5. Design Principles
- HTML-first, works without JS
- Progressive enhancement (HTMX, minimal JS)
- Semantic, accessible markup
- Mobile-first, responsive CSS (Grid/Flexbox)
- Clear validation and error messages
- Consistent navigation and layout

## 6. Risks & Considerations
- Ensure all critical flows work without JavaScript
- Handle real-time updates efficiently (HTMX polling, future WebSocket)
- Graceful error handling and offline scenarios
- Security: CSRF tokens, input validation, role-based access

---

## 7. Frontend Smoke Testing Strategy

To ensure all frontend pages continue to load and function correctly after future changes, we will:
- Add **Playwright smoke tests** for each Core Pages & Components section as they are implemented.
- These tests will verify that key HTML pages render, forms are present, and navigation works as expected.
- Playwright tests will be run as part of CI and before major releases.

#### ... (repeat for each section)

---

**All new Core Pages & Components must include Playwright smoke tests to ensure robust frontend quality.**

**This plan should be reviewed and approved before frontend code is generated.**

## 8. API Documentation Conventions for Frontend Pages

- **All new frontend (HTML) endpoints must use `include_in_schema=False` in their FastAPI route decorators.**
    - This ensures that HTML-only (web-specialized) endpoints are hidden from the OpenAPI schema, Swagger UI, and ReDoc.
    - Only JSON API endpoints intended for programmatic clients should appear in the API docs.
- **When developing new frontend pages or partials:**
    - If the route returns a Jinja2 template or HTMLResponse, always add `include_in_schema=False`.
    - Example:
      ```python
      @router.get("/my-page", response_class=HTMLResponse, include_in_schema=False)
      async def my_page(...):
          ...
      ```
- **Review all new routers for compliance before merging.**

  - **Frontend:** Added Playwright smoke tests for project and organization management, covering navigation, forms, accessibility, and progressive enhancement.

### 2. Testing & Quality Assurance
- **Backend Tests:**
  - Comprehensive tests for organization and project CRUD, validation, and error handling.
  - Service layer tests for `ProjectService` (creation, validation, statistics, status transitions, etc.).
  - **‚úÖ OrganizationService Update Tests:** Verified `update_organization()` method functionality.
- **Frontend Tests:**
  - Playwright tests for project and organization pages, including navigation, form validation, accessibility, and no-JS mode.

## üü¶ DEBUGGING STATUS: Playwright Home Page Navigation Tests (July 2025)

**RESOLVED** ‚úÖ

**Root Cause Identified:**
- The issue was **template caching** in the Docker backend container.
- The backend was serving a cached version of the old template file despite local changes.
- The `get_optional_user` dependency was working correctly and returning `None` for guest users.
- The navbar component was showing correct guest navigation, but the home page template was cached.

**Solution Applied:**
- Restarted the backend container with full rebuild: `docker compose down && docker image rm lms-core-poc-backend && docker compose up -d --build`
- This forced the backend to pick up the updated template files.
- All Playwright home page navigation tests now pass (6/6 passed).

**Lessons Learned:**
- Template changes require backend restart when using Docker containers.
- Always verify template cache invalidation when making Jinja2 template modifications.
- Debug output in templates is useful for diagnosing template context issues.

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ Home page navigation works correctly for both guest and authenticated users
- ‚úÖ All 36 Playwright home page tests passing (6 tests √ó 6 browsers)
- ‚úÖ Template conditional logic (`{% if current_user and current_user.email %}`) working as expected
- ‚úÖ Authentication system functioning correctly with `get_optional_user` dependency
- ‚úÖ Test user credentials fixed (`testpassword123` instead of `password123`)
- ‚úÖ Test logic corrected to properly validate guest vs authenticated navigation states

## Deferred Features

- User API key management (profile page UI and backend) is deferred for now. This is tracked in docs/CONSOLIDATED_TODO.md and will be implemented later.
