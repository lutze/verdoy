## 2. Core Pages & Components

### 2.1. ‚úÖ Authentication (COMPLETED)
- ‚úÖ Login (HTML form, server-side validation)
- ‚úÖ Registration (HTML form with organization selection)
- ‚úÖ Logout (POST endpoint with redirect)
- ‚úÖ Profile (view/edit, change password, API key management)

### 2.2. üÜï Navigation & Routing Strategy (Planned)
- All frontend pages will use a unified `/app` URL prefix for clarity and separation from API endpoints.
- Navigation links and routes will be as follows:
    - `/app` : Base home page
    - `/app/dashboard` : User's overall dashboard (projects, experiments, bioreactors, etc.)
    - `/app/admin/` : Admin area (profile, user, organization info)
    - `/app/admin/profile/` : User profile page
    - `/app/admin/organization/` : Organization info and management
    - `/app/projects` : Project list and detail
    - `/app/experiments` : Experiment management
    - `/app/bioreactors` : Bioreactor management
    - `/app/logout` : Logout endpoint
    - `/app/login` : Login endpoint
- All navigation components and links will be updated to use this structure.
- Existing `/api/v1/` HTML endpoints will be migrated to `/app/` as part of this transition.

### 2.3. üÜï Common Navigation (Planned)
- A shared navigation bar will be included at the top of every page.
- Navigation links will route to the base page for each major function (Dashboard, Organizations, Projects, Processes, Experiments, Bioreactors, Profile).
- The navigation will display a Log In or Log Out button depending on authentication state.
- Navigation will be implemented as a Jinja2 component (`components/navbar.html`) and included in the base template.

### 2.4. üÜï Base Home Page (Planned)
- A root-level home page will be created as the entry point for the application.
- The home page will provide links to all major sections and serve as the foundation for further page development.
- The home page will use the common navigation component.

### 2.5. Dashboard
- List of organizations (cards/list)
- Summary stats (active experiments, online bioreactors)
- Recent activity feed (HTMX polling)

### 2.6. ‚úÖ Organization Management (COMPLETED)
- ‚úÖ Organization list (table/cards) - Enhanced with scientific design system
- ‚úÖ Create organization (form) - Multi-section form with validation
- ‚úÖ Organization detail (tabs: overview, members, projects, bioreactors, settings) - Tabbed interface
- ‚úÖ Organization edit (form) - Pre-populated forms with database updates
- üîÑ Member management (invite, remove, role change) - UI complete, backend pending
- ‚ùå Organization archive/delete - Soft delete functionality pending

### 2.7. Project Management
- Project list (per organization)
- Create project (form)
- Project detail (processes, experiments, bioreactors, metadata)

### 2.8. Process Designer
- List of processes (per project)
- Process detail (steps, logic)
- Interactive designer (add/remove steps, configure logic, HTMX for dynamic fields)
- Save as template

### 2.9. Experiment Management
- Create experiment (select process, bioreactor)
- Experiment detail (status, controls, real-time data, history)
- Monitor experiment (HTMX polling for live data)
- Start/pause/stop controls

### 2.10. Bioreactor Management
- Enrollment (multi-step form, sensor/actuator config)
- Bioreactor dashboard (real-time sensor data, status, controls)
- Manual control panel (actuators, safety confirmations)

### 2.11. User Profile
- View/edit info
- Change password
- API key management
- Notification preferences

## 3. Integration Points
- All forms submit to FastAPI backend endpoints (HTML response)
- HTMX used for:
  - Polling (real-time data, activity feeds)
  - Dynamic form fields (add/remove steps, sensors, actuators)
  - Partial updates (modals, inline edits)
- WebSocket endpoints for live experiment/bioreactor data (future enhancement)

## 4. Implementation Milestones

1. **‚úÖ Setup**: Add templates/ and static/ directories, configure FastAPI for Jinja2 and static files **COMPLETE**
2. **‚úÖ Base Template**: Create `base.html` with navigation, layout, and responsive design **COMPLETE**
3. **‚úÖ Authentication**: Implement login, registration, logout, and profile pages **COMPLETE**
4. **‚úÖ Dashboard**: Build user dashboard with orgs, stats, and activity feed **COMPLETE**
5. **üÜï Navigation Refactor**: Update all frontend routes and navigation to use `/app`-based URLs **NEXT**
6. **üÜï Base Home Page**: Create a root-level home page as the main entry point **NEXT**
7. **‚úÖ Organization Management**: CRUD flows for organizations **COMPLETE**
8. **üéØ Project Management**: CRUD flows for projects **UPCOMING**
9. **Bioreactor Enrollment/Monitoring**: Multi-step form, real-time dashboard
10. **Process Designer**: Interactive step/logic management with HTMX
11. **Experiment Management**: Create, monitor, and control experiments
12. **Polish**: Accessibility, error handling, mobile optimization, inline validation

### üîß **Recent Technical Fixes**
- Fixed Docker static file path: `directory="app/static"`
- Fixed Docker templates path: `directory="app/templates"`
- Resolved container startup issues
- Verified API endpoints and template rendering
- **Authentication System**: Complete with content negotiation
- **Navigation Component**: Responsive navbar with authentication state
- **Router Registration**: Fixed auth routes with `/api/v1` prefix consistency

### üìã **Development Best Practices Learned**
- **Docker Rebuilds**: Always force complete rebuild (`docker compose down && docker compose build --no-cache && docker compose up -d`) when making route or backend structural changes
- **Content Negotiation**: Single endpoints serving both HTML and JSON based on Accept headers
- **API Consistency**: Maintain `/api/v1` prefix for all endpoints (web browsers and programmatic clients)
- **Template Caching**: Python import caching can prevent route changes from taking effect without full rebuild

## 5. Design Principles
- HTML-first, works without JS
- Progressive enhancement (HTMX, minimal JS)
- Semantic, accessible markup
- Mobile-first, responsive CSS (Grid/Flexbox)
- Clear validation and error messages
- Consistent navigation and layout

## 6. Risks & Considerations
- Ensure all critical flows work without JavaScript
- Handle real-time updates efficiently (HTMX polling, future WebSocket)
- Graceful error handling and offline scenarios
- Security: CSRF tokens, input validation, role-based access

---

## 7. Frontend Smoke Testing Strategy

To ensure all frontend pages continue to load and function correctly after future changes, we will:
- Add **Playwright smoke tests** for each Core Pages & Components section as they are implemented.
- These tests will verify that key HTML pages render, forms are present, and navigation works as expected.
- Playwright tests will be run as part of CI and before major releases.

### Playwright Smoke Test Coverage

#### Authentication Pages (COMPLETED)
- [ ] Login page loads and form is visible (`/api/v1/auth/login`)
- [ ] Registration page loads and form is visible (`/api/v1/auth/register`)

#### ... (repeat for each section)

---

**All new Core Pages & Components must include Playwright smoke tests to ensure robust frontend quality.**

**This plan should be reviewed and approved before frontend code is generated.**

## 8. API Documentation Conventions for Frontend Pages

- **All new frontend (HTML) endpoints must use `include_in_schema=False` in their FastAPI route decorators.**
    - This ensures that HTML-only (web-specialized) endpoints are hidden from the OpenAPI schema, Swagger UI, and ReDoc.
    - Only JSON API endpoints intended for programmatic clients should appear in the API docs.
- **When developing new frontend pages or partials:**
    - If the route returns a Jinja2 template or HTMLResponse, always add `include_in_schema=False`.
    - Example:
      ```python
      @router.get("/my-page", response_class=HTMLResponse, include_in_schema=False)
      async def my_page(...):
          ...
      ```
- **Review all new routers for compliance before merging.**

## üìù July 2025 Development Progress & Next Steps

### 1. Progress Summary
- **Navigation Consistency:** All navigation links (navbar, dashboard quick actions) now use correct `/app/` routes. Projects and Organizations are accessible and consistent.
- **Organization Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete/Archive) for organizations, with both HTML and JSON API endpoints. Templates for list, create, edit, and detail pages are in place.
  - **‚úÖ Organization Edit Page:** Complete edit functionality with scientific design system, pre-populated forms, and successful database updates.
  - **‚úÖ OrganizationService Update Method:** Added `update_organization()` method with proper validation and audit logging.
  - **‚úÖ Edit Template:** Comprehensive edit form with structured sections (basic info, contact, address, settings, status).
  - **‚úÖ Form Validation:** Required fields, error handling, and form data preservation on validation errors.
  - **‚úÖ Testing Verification:** Confirmed edit page loads, form pre-population works, and database updates succeed.
- **Project Management:**
  - **Backend:** New `Project` model, Pydantic schemas, and `ProjectService` for business logic.
  - **API:** CRUD endpoints for projects, with both HTML and JSON support.
  - **Frontend:** Templates for project list, create, and detail pages. Navigation and dashboard quick actions updated.
- **Content Negotiation:** All new endpoints support both HTML and JSON responses, following project rules.
- **Testing Infrastructure:**
  - **Backend:** Added/updated pytest-based tests for organizations and projects (API and service layer).
  - **Frontend:** Added Playwright smoke tests for project and organization management, covering navigation, forms, accessibility, and progressive enhancement.

### 2. Testing & Quality Assurance
- **Backend Tests:**
  - Comprehensive tests for organization and project CRUD, validation, and error handling.
  - Service layer tests for `ProjectService` (creation, validation, statistics, status transitions, etc.).
  - **‚úÖ OrganizationService Update Tests:** Verified `update_organization()` method functionality.
- **Frontend Tests:**
  - Playwright tests for project and organization pages, including navigation, form validation, accessibility, and no-JS mode.
  - Tests follow the documented [Frontend Testing Strategy](docs/testing/FRONTEND_TESTING_STRATEGY.md).
  - **‚úÖ Edit Page Testing:** Verified edit page loads, form pre-population, and successful updates.

### 3. Bug Discovery & Resolution
- **SQLAlchemy Reserved Name:** The `Project` model used the attribute `metadata`, which is reserved in SQLAlchemy's Declarative API. This caused backend test failures. **RESOLVED** - Renamed to `project_metadata` throughout all code and tests.
- **Device Validation Issues:** Backend tests failing due to Pydantic validation errors in DeviceCreate schema and Entity-based Device model architecture mismatches. **RESOLVED** - Fixed schema alignment, JSON property handling, and Entity-based device creation.
- **Database Schema Alignment:** Fixed foreign key references and Entity-based architecture integration for Project model. **RESOLVED** - Updated Project model to properly reference `entities.id` and fixed SQLAlchemy relationships.
- **CredentialsException Parameter Issue:** Backend was failing due to `CredentialsException` being called with `detail` parameter when the class doesn't accept it. **RESOLVED** - Fixed all instances in `dependencies.py` and `api_auth.py` to call `CredentialsException()` without parameters.

### 4. Organization Management Feature Status

#### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED Features**

## üü¶ NEXT STEPS: Implementation Checklist

### 1. Navigation Refactor & Base Home Page

**Goal:** Ensure all navigation links are consistent, `/app`-based, and the home page is a clear, accessible entry point.

#### Implementation Checklist

1. **Navigation Review & Refactor**
   - [x] Audit all navigation links in templates/components for consistency
   - [x] Update all links to use `/app`-based URLs (dashboard, orgs, projects, profile, etc.)

## üü¶ DEBUGGING STATUS: Playwright Home Page Navigation Tests (July 2025)

**RESOLVED** ‚úÖ

**Root Cause Identified:**
- The issue was **template caching** in the Docker backend container.
- The backend was serving a cached version of the old template file despite local changes.
- The `get_optional_user` dependency was working correctly and returning `None` for guest users.
- The navbar component was showing correct guest navigation, but the home page template was cached.

**Solution Applied:**
- Restarted the backend container with full rebuild: `docker compose down && docker image rm lms-core-poc-backend && docker compose up -d --build`
- This forced the backend to pick up the updated template files.
- All Playwright home page navigation tests now pass (6/6 passed).

**Lessons Learned:**
- Template changes require backend restart when using Docker containers.
- Always verify template cache invalidation when making Jinja2 template modifications.
- Debug output in templates is useful for diagnosing template context issues.

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ Home page navigation works correctly for both guest and authenticated users
- ‚úÖ All 36 Playwright home page tests passing (6 tests √ó 6 browsers)
- ‚úÖ Template conditional logic (`{% if current_user and current_user.email %}`) working as expected
- ‚úÖ Authentication system functioning correctly with `get_optional_user` dependency
- ‚úÖ Test user credentials fixed (`testpassword123` instead of `password123`)
- ‚úÖ Test logic corrected to properly validate guest vs authenticated navigation states

## Deferred Features

- User API key management (profile page UI and backend) is deferred for now. This is tracked in docs/CONSOLIDATED_TODO.md and will be implemented later.
