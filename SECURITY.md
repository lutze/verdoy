## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report

Please report security vulnerabilities by emailing us at [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) with the following information:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- We will provide regular updates on our progress
- We will credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep your installation updated** - Always use the latest stable version
2. **Use strong passwords** - Ensure all user accounts have strong, unique passwords
3. **Enable HTTPS** - Always use HTTPS in production environments
4. **Regular backups** - Maintain regular backups of your data
5. **Monitor access logs** - Regularly review access logs for suspicious activity

### For Developers

1. **Environment Variables** - Never commit secrets or credentials to version control
2. **Input Validation** - Always validate and sanitize user inputs
3. **SQL Injection Prevention** - Use parameterized queries and ORM methods
4. **Authentication** - Implement proper authentication and authorization
5. **HTTPS Only** - Ensure all communications use HTTPS in production

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based authentication with configurable expiration
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Organization-based data isolation
- API key authentication for IoT devices

### Data Protection

- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Encrypted database connections
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention

### Network Security

- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting
- Request size limits
- WebSocket security

## Known Security Considerations

### Development vs Production

- Default credentials are provided for development only
- Debug mode should never be enabled in production
- SQLite should not be used in production environments
- Secret keys must be changed from default values

### IoT Device Security

- Device API keys should be rotated regularly
- Network communication should be encrypted
- Device firmware should be kept updated
- Implement proper device authentication

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as soon as possible after a vulnerability is discovered and patched. We will:

- Release patches for supported versions
- Provide detailed security advisories
- Credit security researchers appropriately
- Maintain a changelog of security fixes
